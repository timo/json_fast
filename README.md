JSON::Fast
==========

A naive imperative JSON parser in pure Raku (but with direct access to `nqp::` ops), to evaluate performance against `JSON::Tiny`. It is a drop-in replacement for `JSON::Tiny`â€™s from-json and to-json subs, but it offers a few extra features.

Currently it seems to be about 4x faster and uses up about a quarter of the RAM JSON::Tiny would use.

This module also includes a very fast to-json function that tony-o created and lizmat later completely refactored.

Exported subroutines
--------------------

### to-json

        my $*JSON_NAN_INF_SUPPORT = 1; # allow NaN, Inf, and -Inf to be serialized.
        say to-json [<my Raku data structure>];
        say to-json [<my Raku data structure>], :!pretty;
        say to-json [<my Raku data structure>], :spacing(4);

    enum Blerp <Hello Goodbye>;
    say to-json [Hello, Goodbye]; # ["Hello", "Goodbye"]
    say to-json [Hello, Goodbye], :enums-as-value; # [0, 1]

Encode a Raku data structure into JSON. Takes one positional argument, which is a thing you want to encode into JSON. Takes these optional named arguments:

#### pretty

`Bool`. Defaults to `True`. Specifies whether the output should be "pretty", human-readable JSON. When set to false, will output json in a single line.

#### spacing

`Int`. Defaults to `2`. Applies only when `pretty` is `True`. Controls how much spacing there is between each nested level of the output.

#### sorted-keys

Specifies whether keys from objects should be sorted before serializing them to a string or if `$obj.keys` is good enough. Defaults to `False`. Can also be specified as a `Callable` with the same type of argument that the `.sort` method accepts to provide alternate sorting methods.

#### enum-as-value

`Bool`, defaults to `False`. Specifies whether `enum`s should be json-ified as their underlying values, instead of as the name of the `enum`.

#### converter

`Callable`, defaults to undefined Callable. Whenever to-json encounters a type it doesn't know how to serialize, JSON::Fast will call .^cando on this callable with the value in question, and if one or more candidates are returned, the first candidate will be called with the value, and the result will be passed into the jsonify sub again, so you should return a value that is "more digestible", especially to prevent infinite recursion.

The recommended way to use the converter feature is to pass a multi sub.

An easy default for converters is *.Str that will stringify anything if possible, or *.raku which will often get you more detail out of objects.

JSON::Fast will not attempt to call the converter before going through all its built-in types.

### from-json

        my $x = from-json '["foo", "bar", {"ber": "bor"}]';
        say $x.perl;
        # outputs: $["foo", "bar", {:ber("bor")}]

Takes one positional argument that is coerced into a `Str` type and represents a JSON text to decode. Returns a Raku datastructure representing that JSON.

#### immutable

`Bool`. Defaults to `False`. Specifies whether `Hash`es and `Array`s should be rendered as immutable datastructures instead (as `Map` / `List`. Creating an immutable data structures is mostly saving on memory usage, and a little bit on CPU (typically around 5%).

This also has the side effect that elements from the returned structure can now be iterated over directly because they are not containerized.

        my %hash := from-json "META6.json".IO.slurp, :immutable;
        say "Provides:";
        .say for %hash<provides>;

#### allow-jsonc

`Bool`. Defaults to `False`. Specifies whether commmands adhering to the [JSONC standard](https://changelog.com/news/jsonc-is-a-superset-of-json-which-supports-comments-6LwR) are allowed.

Additional features
-------------------

### Adapting defaults of "from-json"

In the `use` statement, you can add the string `"immutable"` to make the default of the `immutable` parameter to the `from-json` subroutine `True`, rather than False.

        use JSON::Fast <immutable>;  # create immutable data structures by default

### Adapting defaults of "to-json"

In the `use` statement, you can add the strings `"!pretty"`, `"sorted-keys"` and/or `"enums-as-value"` to change the associated defaults of the `to-json` subroutine.

        use JSON::FAST <!pretty sorted-keys enums-as-value>;

### Strings containing multiple json pieces

When the document contains additional non-whitespace after the first successfully parsed JSON object, JSON::Fast will throw the exception `X::JSON::AdditionalContent`. If you expect multiple objects, you can catch that exception, retrieve the parse result from its `parsed` attribute, and remove the first `rest-position` characters off of the string and restart parsing from there.
